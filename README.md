# Stroke-Risk-Data-Diagnosis
This project focuses on identifying key health factors that contribute to stroke risk using machine learning techniques. I performed end-to-end data analysis, from preprocessing to building predictive models
# Project Highlights
High Accuracy: Achieved 99% accuracy using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and 95% accuracy with Random Forest Classifier
# Key Process
- Data Diagnosis & Cleaning: Handled missing values and data imbalances to ensure high-quality input.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified correlations between lifestyle factors and stroke occurrences.

- Model Evaluation: Tested multiple algorithms to find the most effective predictive solution
